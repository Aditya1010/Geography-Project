The first formula One race ever was held in 1947. Whereas the World Championships were not held until 1950.
In the 1950s and 1960s there were many Formula One races that did not count for the World Championship[142] (e.g., in 1950, a total of twenty-two Formula One races were held, of which only six counted towards the World Championship). The number of non-championship Formula One events decreased throughout the 1970s and 1980s, to the point where the last non-championship Formula One race was the 1983 Race of Champions.
The World Championship was not always exclusively composed of Formula One events.
The World Championships were originally named the World Championships for Drivers ie. without the term Formula One in it. It was only called the FIA Formula One in 1981.
From 1952 and 1953, all races counting towards the World Championship(except Indianapollis 500) were run to Formula Two regulations.
